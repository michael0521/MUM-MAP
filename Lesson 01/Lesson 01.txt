 In the first lesson, I learned to install Android Studio, import an Eclipse ADT existing project to Android Studio,
and enable the Android tablet in debug mode. Finally, push the FruitSlick app into the tablet, and test it in real hardware.
Then I new sample project which is blank activity with Android 6.0 SDK, and 'Run' it in both real tablet and Android Virtual
Divce.

 I also learned the lifecyle states of Activity in Android platform. How each state change to another state. And also learned
Android project structure, and the functionality of each panel in Android studio.
